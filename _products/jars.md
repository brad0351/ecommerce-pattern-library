  This is 100% hipster. It is water in a mason jar. It comes in a 6-pack box, just like vintage glass soda cases, but it is way healthier. It has no smell and little taste. Plus, it is safe to show off without appearing ordinary. It is perfect for hot summer days to help you feel cool in the heat. The glass will stay nice and cool when refrigerated and you can put ice in it. Diet water is all natural and is an ancient secret of all civilization prior to beverages just being unhealthy liquid sugar. Below is a quote from a hipster on water.
