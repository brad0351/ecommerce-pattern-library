  This box in not plastic. It is recyclable and also decomposable. It comes in a 6-pack, just like juice boxes, but it is way healthier. It has no smell and little taste. Plus, it is safe to give messy kids as it does not stain. It is perfect for hot summer days to help you feel cool in the heat. The box will stay nice and cool when refrigerated. Diet water is all natural and is an ancient secret of all civilization prior to beverages just being unhealthy liquid sugar. Below is a quote from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on trying to describe the water box.
