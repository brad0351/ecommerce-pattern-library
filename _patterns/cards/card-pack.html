    <p class="text island-1-2">This can is not only 100% hydrating, it is also 100% recyclable aluminum. It comes in a 6-pack, just like beer, but it is way healthier. It has no smell and little taste. Plus, it is safe to drive after consuming it. It is perfect for hot summer days to help you feel cool in the heat. The can will stay nice and cool when refrigerated. Diet water is all natural and is an ancient secret of all civilization prior to beverages just being unhealthy liquid sugar. Below is a quote from a doctor Seuss on the importance of water.</p>
